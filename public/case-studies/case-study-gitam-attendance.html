          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            The initial version of my attendance calculator successfully automated data entry, but user feedback revealed a desire for a more robust, persistent experience. Students wanted to track their attendance over time, see a holistic dashboard, and make live adjustments (e.g., marking a class as attended/missed) without having to re-paste data from the portal for every small change.
          </p>
          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The objective was to evolve the tool from a single-use utility into a comprehensive, personalized attendance management dashboard. This required implementing secure user accounts, a persistent database for storing attendance data, and a dynamic UI that would allow for live tracking and "what-if" scenarios for each course.

          <h3>The Approach</h3>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>User Feedback & Planning</h4>
              <p>
                I actively gathered and analyzed feedback from users of the first version. Based on their input, I planned a V2 architecture centered around user accounts and a persistent dashboard experience.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>System Design & Technology</h4>
              <p>
                I chose the MERN stack and integrated Firebase for its robust and easy-to-implement Authentication and Firestore database. The backend Node.js server was enhanced to handle user data and re-parsing requests securely.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Iterative Development</h4>
              <p>
                The front-end was completely rebuilt in React to support a component-based, card-style dashboard. I focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface where users could see their overall status and individual course progress at a glance.

          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Secure Firebase Authentication</h4>
              <p>Users can create secure accounts to save their attendance data, providing a personalized and persistent experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Live Attendance Dashboard</h4>
              <p>An intuitive dashboard that displays overall status and a detailed breakdown for each course in organized cards.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Automated Data Parsing</h4>
              <p>The core feature remains: users paste raw data from the GITAM portal, and the backend parses it instantly to populate the dashboard.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Interactive Tracking</h4>
              <p>Users can manually mark classes as "Present" or "Absent" to see real-time updates to their percentages without needing to re-parse data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Per-Course Goal Calculator</h4>
              <p>Each course card includes a calculator to determine exactly how many classes must be attended to reach a specific goal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>One-Click Data Update</h4>
              <p>A simple "Update Data" button allows users to refresh their attendance by pasting new data from the portal at any time.</p>

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            G-Tracker evolved from a simple utility into an indispensable, personalized dashboard for GITAM students. The introduction of user accounts and live tracking dramatically increased user engagement and retention. The application now provides a complete solution for attendance management, not just calculation, making it a far more powerful and valuable tool.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project was a crucial lesson in iterative development and the importance of listening to user feedback. I significantly enhanced my skills in full-stack development by integrating a third-party service like Firebase for authentication and database management. It taught me how to scale a simple idea into a full-fledged, secure, and user-centric web application.
