          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Users often face friction during login and navigation processes due
            to unclear flows, inconsistent layouts, or poor error handling.
            Without clear process mapping, design gaps remain hidden until late
            in development, causing usability issues.
          </p>
          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The objective was to create a low-fidelity prototype that visualized
            user flows early, exposed potential obstacles, and incorporated UX
            best practices. The focus was on building a strong foundation for
            usability before moving into high-fidelity design.

            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Discovery & Planning</h4>
              <p>
                I analyzed common login and navigation pain points, mapping the
                user journey from entry to task completion. Key friction areas
                like unclear error states and inconsistent button placement were
                identified.

              <h4>Design & Prototyping</h4>
              <p>
                Using Figma, I designed a low-fidelity prototype focusing on
                simplicity and clarity. Interactive flows were created for the
                login process, navigation, and error handling. The design
                prioritized usability principles such as consistency, hierarchy,
                and minimalism.

              <h4>Iteration & Feedback</h4>
              <p>
                The prototype was tested with sample user flows to validate
                clarity and efficiency. Adjustments were made to improve error
                messaging and align navigation with user expectations.

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            The prototype provided a clear visualization of the login and
            navigation process, ensuring usability issues were addressed early.
            It became a blueprint for transitioning into high-fidelity design
            with fewer revisions.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project reinforced the importance of low-fidelity prototyping
            in the UX process. I learned how early mapping of user flows reduces
            costly errors later and how interactive prototypes communicate
            design intent more effectively than static wireframes.
