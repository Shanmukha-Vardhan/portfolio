          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            At GITAM University, with a sprawling campus and complex building
            layouts, students frequently struggled to locate their assigned
            classrooms. This led to delays, confusion, and wasted time,
            especially at the beginning of new semesters when orientation and
            schedule changes were common.
          </p>
          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The goal was to develop a centralized, mobile-first web application
            that would provide instant, accurate classroom location information
            through a simple search function, reducing confusion and improving
            navigation.

          <h3>The Approach</h3>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Discovery & Planning</h4>
              <p>
                I started by identifying the core problem: students needed a
                quick way to search and find their classrooms. I mapped the user
                flow around three main actions: Search → Find → Navigate.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Design & Prototyping</h4>
              <p>
                I created low-fidelity sketches to test layouts, focusing on a
                clean and intuitive search interface. Usability and clarity were
                prioritized so even first-time users could locate a classroom in
                seconds.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Development & Technology</h4>
              <p>
                For the backend, I used Node.js and SQLite to ensure fast,
                efficient queries with minimal setup. On the frontend, React.js
                and vanilla JavaScript were chosen to make the interface
                interactive and lightweight.

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Real-Time Search</h4>
              <p>
                Instant results appear as the user types, minimizing wait time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Detailed Room Info</h4>
              <p>
                Each result includes classroom number, building name, floor
                level, and helpful navigation hints.

            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
              <p>
                A mobile-first UI that adapts to any device, ensuring
                accessibility for all students.

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            The final application delivered a simple yet effective solution to
            the navigation problem. Students could instantly find their
            classrooms, reducing confusion and wasted time. The project
            successfully demonstrated a complete full-stack workflow, from
            problem discovery to final deployment.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project strengthened my skills in backend optimization and
            responsive frontend development. I learned the importance of
            building mobile-first solutions and how to structure data
            efficiently for real-world usability. It also reinforced the value
            of starting with user needs before jumping into development.
