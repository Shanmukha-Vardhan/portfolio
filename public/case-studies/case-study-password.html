          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Weak and reused passwords are one of the leading causes of data
            breaches. Most password strength meters only check for length or
            complexity, ignoring whether a password has already been compromised
            in known leaks. Users need a tool that not only rates password
            strength but also validates its safety against global breach
            databases.
          </p>
          <h3>The Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The goal was to design a responsive, secure application that
            empowers users to create strong, breach-free passwords. By
            integrating real-time strength validation with external APIs, the
            application ensures users have immediate, actionable insights into
            their password security.

          <h3>The Approach</h3>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Discovery & Planning</h4>
              <p>
                The problem definition centered around two main issues: password
                strength evaluation and breach detection. I planned a solution
                that combined both into a single user-friendly tool.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Design & Prototyping</h4>
              <p>
                I created a minimal, responsive UI where users could input
                passwords and immediately view strength feedback. Special
                attention was given to accessibility and clear visual indicators
                for weak vs. strong passwords.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
              <h4>Development & Technology</h4>
              <p>
                The backend was built with Node.js and Express.js, while the
                frontend was developed in React.js for real-time interactivity.
                I integrated the HaveIBeenPwned API to check if passwords were
                found in known breaches.

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            The application successfully provided a comprehensive solution for
            improving password security. Users were able to not only test the
            strength of their passwords but also ensure that they had not been
            exposed in any known breaches.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project taught me the importance of integrating external APIs
            into full-stack applications, handling sensitive user input
            securely, and designing interfaces that balance usability with
            security. It was a key milestone in advancing my skills in
            security-focused web development.
